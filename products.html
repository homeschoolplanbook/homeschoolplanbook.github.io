                    <h1>Elementary Edition</h1>
                    <h4>Price: $19.99</h4>
                    <p>This book is for the records of one elementary student, and is our most 
                        popular book of all. Parents may track in detail the work done for a 
                        complete calendar year--seven days per week, fifty-two weeks per year. 
                        The weekly pages have nine subjects listed across the top, and days of the week 
                        (all seven) listed down the side. Hours may be tallied at the bottom of the 
                        page, or on the separate pages near the back. Also included are pages for 
                        recording books read, memory work, a grade card, field trips, projects, and 
                        more. <i>Designed for grades K-8th</i></p>

                    <h1>High School Edition</h1>
                    <h4>Price: $19.99</h4>
                    <p>Regardless of your student's future plans, this book will neatly keep the 
                        necessary records. The weekly-pages format is a two-page spread. The days 
                        of the week are listed down the side, with spaces for subjects across the top. 
                        These spaces are left blank so that you can fill them in. <i>Designed for grades 9-12</i></p>

                    <h1>Family Edition</h1>
                    <h4>Price: $22.49</h4>
                    <p>This is very similar to the Unit Studies Edition and the Elementary Edition. 
                        The only difference is in the weekly pages. Both left and right hand pages 
                        are subdivided into two large blocks that are further subdivided into small 
                        sections. These small sections are labeled by subject. Work is therefore 
                        tracked by the week, not by the day.</p>
